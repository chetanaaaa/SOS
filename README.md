SAVE OUR SOULS(SOS) project aims to develop a customized and cost-efficient wearable safety and alarm device utilizing IoT
technologies. The device is designed to be user-friendly, targeting individuals, especially children and senior
citizens, who may find themselves in distress due to safety concerns or medical conditions.
* This device is equipped with an A9G board for GPRS and GPS functionalities, as well as an ESP32 XIAO C3
board for enhanced connectivity.
* Through this device the person not only gets alert with location of a insecure person but also can hear the
conversation happening in the other side which helps him know the location/situation of his unsecure friend/family
